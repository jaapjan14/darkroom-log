# Darkroom Log

Self-hosted darkroom printing log and analog photo library, built for Immich integration.

![Prints tab — searchable, tag-filtered grid of every print](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaapjan14/darkroom-log/main/screenshots/01-prints-grid.png)

Each print page records full exposure data (shutter / aperture / ISO / lens), tags, every print
session you've made of it (paper, enlarger, lens, exposure, dodge/burn notes), and chips for any
album the print belongs to so you can jump straight to that album from the print itself.

Albums double as **public, shareable galleries** — each gets its own URL with a custom branded
header, optional slideshow, and pinch-zoom on every photo. No login required for viewers.

## What's new in v1.5.60–61

A focused pass on **mobile / cellular performance** — browsing the library and public album galleries on a phone (5G) is now fast and smooth, with no dead taps or skipped photos. (v1.5.61 adds post-release hardening: a type-agnostic fallback so the fullscreen viewer never breaks on video/RAW originals, library queries filtered to images, and a few nav-feedback refinements.)

- **Instant photo viewing on slow connections** — the library detail view, Prints detail, and public album viewers now paint a lightweight, screen-sized image immediately and stream the full-resolution original in behind it, instead of blocking on a multi-megabyte download. Opening or paging through photos no longer feels dead on cellular, and a slow metadata fetch can no longer blank or "fail" the photo.
- **Fullscreen prev/next, no jump** — on mobile the fullscreen viewer leads with a connection-adaptive display variant (fills the screen right away, then sharpens) and prefetches the neighbouring photos, so prev/next is instant. A 350 ms nav guard means one tap advances exactly one photo (no more ghost-click skipping). Desktop keeps the plain high-res path.
- **Public album grids ~20–30× lighter** — gallery thumbnails now load Immich's small thumbnail (~16 KB) instead of the ~600 KB preview, so a shared album opens fast on mobile data.
- **Filtered-library sorting fixed** — applying a tile filter (e.g. a lens model) and then switching Upload date / Date taken no longer empties the grid; the filtered results sort client-side instead of falling back to a broken re-filter.
- **Slideshow display variant** — slideshow images are server-resized via sharp at a connection-adaptive width (960 / 1280 / 1920 px), fixing black frames on poor wifi where the full original used to fail to decode. Originals still power the lightbox + pinch-zoom.

## What's new in v1.5

- **In-Albums chips on every print and Recent photo** — see at a glance which Darkroom albums each image is in; click to jump straight to the album.
- **Public album detail view** — tapping a thumbnail in `/album/<slug>` opens a library-style two-column layout with EXIF (description, date, camera, lens, location), separate from the fullscreen Ken Burns slideshow.
- **Pinch-zoom fullscreen viewer** — public album fullscreen is now image-only with 1×–5× pinch, pan-when-zoomed, double-tap toggle, swipe-down to close. Trackpad two-finger swipe-up also closes.
- **Album metadata API** — expanded `/api/public/photo/:id` returns full EXIF (make, model, lens, focal length, shutter, aperture, ISO, date, city/state/country) for the public viewer. GPS lat/long never leave the server.
- **Mobile Load More smoothness** — fixed cumulative scroll drift across multi-page library loads; fast-path append now keeps the DOM above untouched.
- **Session arrow-key fix** — opening "+ Session" no longer leaks left/right arrows into print navigation, so sessions can't accidentally land on the wrong print.
- **Lazy-loaded albums** — opening a print or Recent photo before visiting the Albums tab no longer silently shows zero album chips; albums fetch on demand.
